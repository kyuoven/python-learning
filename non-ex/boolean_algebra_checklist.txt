1. Find an equality test (== or !=) and replace it with its truth.
2. Find each and/or inside parentheses and solve those first.
3. Find each not and invert it.
4. Find any remaining and/or and solve it.
5. When you are done you should have True or False.
I will demonstrate with a variation on #20:
3 != 4 and not ("testing" != "test" or "Python" == "Python")
Here’s me going through each of the steps and showing you the translation
until I’ve boiled it down to a single result:
1. Solve each equality test:
3 != 4 is True: True and not ("testing" != "test" or "Python" == "Python")
"testing" != "test" is True: True and not (True or "Python" == "Python")
"Python" == "Python": True and not (True or True)
2. Find each and/or in parentheses ():
(True or True) is True: True and not (True)
3. Find each not and invert it:
not (True) is False: True and False
4. Find any remaining and/or and solve them:
True and False is False
With that we’re done and know the result is False.
