CLASS X(OBJECT): DEF M(SELF,J)          Class X has-a function named M that takes self and J parameters
FOO = X()                               Set foo to an instance of class X
FOO.M(J)                                From foo, get the M function and call it with parameters self, J
FOO.K = Q                               From foo, get the K attribute and et it to Q
