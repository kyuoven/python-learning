hi 
notes

a hashtag is also called a pound(preferably), it hides lines of code when you eventually pull it.
"Anything after the pound is ignored by python

= (equal sign) gives data numbers, strings, etc names (aka variables)
The = (single-equal) assigns the value on the right to a variable on the left. The == (double-equal) tests whether two things have the same value. 

Every time you put " (double quotes) around a piece of text you have been making a string. A string is how you make something that your program might give to a human. You print strings, save strings to files, send strings to web servers, and many other things. 

In Python source code, an f-string is a literal string, prefixed with 'f', which contains expressions inside braces. The expressions are replaced with their values.

A string is usually a bit of text you want to display to someone or “export” out of the program you are writing. Python knows you want something to be a string when you put either " (double-quotes) or ' (single-quotes) around the text. You saw this many times with your use of print when you put the text you want to go inside the string inside " or ' after the print to print the string. 

if formatting is still confusing, check exercise seven, seven_k and eight.

using backslash + n puts a new line character into a string
"This \ (backslash) character encodes difficult-to-type characters into a string."

ex11.py: Warning!
We put a end=' ' at the end of each print line. This tells print to not end
the line with a newline character and go to the next line.

ex12.py: When you typed input() you were typing the ( and ) characters, which are
parenthesis characters. This is similar to when you used them to do a
format with extra variables, as in f"{x} {y}". For input you can also put in
a prompt to show to a person so he knows what to type. Put a string that you
want for the prompt inside the () so that it looks like this:
y = input("Name?")
This prompts the user with “Name?” and puts the result into the variable y.
This is how you ask someone a question and get the answe

important: page 69 of pdf!!! about argv!!!!!!!!!!

Functions do three things:
1. They name pieces of code the way variables name strings and numbers.
2. They take arguments the way your scripts take argv.
3. Using 1 and 2, they let you make your own "mini-scripts" or "tiny
commands."

good exercise/explanation for for-loops, .append, range and lists: ex32.py

 ordinal == ordered, 1st; cardinal == cards at random, 0.

 ex52: i am at my FINAL excercise!! this has been a ride, i will hopefully be able to run memeweb on a browser by tonight :)!
