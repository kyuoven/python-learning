a hashtag is also called a pound(preferably), it hides lines of code when you eventually pull it.
"Anything after the pound is ignored by python

= (equal sign) gives data numbers, strings, etc names (aka variables)
The = (single-equal) assigns the value on the right to a variable on the left. The == (double-equal) tests whether two things have the same value. 

Every time you put " (double quotes) around a piece of text you have been making a string. A string is how you make something that your program might give to a human. You print strings, save strings to files, send strings to web servers, and many other things. 

In Python source code, an f-string is a literal string, prefixed with 'f', which contains expressions inside braces. The expressions are replaced with their values.

A string is usually a bit of text you want to display to someone or “export” out of the program you are writing. Python knows you want something to be a string when you put either " (double-quotes) or ' (single-quotes) around the text. You saw this many times with your use of print when you put the text you want to go inside the string inside " or ' after the print to print the string.
